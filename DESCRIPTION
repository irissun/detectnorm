Description: Non-normality could greatly distort the meta-analytic results, according to the simulation in Sun and Cheung (2020) <doi: 10.3758/s13428-019-01334-x>. This package aims to detect non-normality for two independent groups with only limited descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.
